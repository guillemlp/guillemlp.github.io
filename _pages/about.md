About me 
======

I am a PhD student (3rd year) in Computer Architecture at Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) and Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC). I focus on mechanisms to  connect coherent hardware accelerators to the memory hierarchy of the CPU. Currently, I have collaborations with industry (Arm), and Academia (UCSB). I have 3 papers at international conferences as first author (ICPP 21, DATE 23, SAMOS 23), and several papers at journals and conferences as co-author (DCIS, DSD, DATE). I received a schoalrship to do the PhD from the catalan governement as well as funding from Arm to do reserach.  

I am always looking for further collaborations or internships/research stages. My interests include networks, interconnects for accelerators, hardware accelerators, FPGA, RTL Simulation, Simulators, and in general Computer Architecture.

I am currently looking for new RTL projects to be accelerated by Metro-MPI. Metro-MPI is a methodology to speed-up RTL Simulations using MPI. It works particularly well in OpenPiton, obtaining super-linear speeupds with Verilator. You can find more info at: www.github.com/metro-mpi
